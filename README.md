## DFA review: 
- imprecision in sinusoid, gaussian noise or real application (ladybug)
- fractality partially modelled with DFA: alpha decrease after a certain complexity (fractality-convolution) level 

## 2 main research tracks:
- imprecise DFA: take into account the final regression quality of fit to output alpha interval
- replace fluctuation focus by distribution patterns/shapes observed at different time scales (days, week, months, year, ...)
